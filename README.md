# AniLine

AniLine is an innovative application that combines the power of AI-generated images with elegant single-line art animation. This project is inspired by and builds upon the fantastic work of [Javier Bórquez's pintr](https://github.com/javierbyte/pintr) and [vivus-instant](https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus-instant).

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Utilizes Stability AI's API to create images from text descriptions.
- **Single-Line Art Conversion:** Transforms generated images into beautiful single-line style artworks, inspired by the pintr project.
- **SVG Animation:** Converts the single-line artworks into animated SVGs using vivus-instant.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Enables efficient creation of animated, single-line style graphics for video production directly from text input.

## How It Works

1. User inputs a text description.
2. The app generates an image using Stability AI's API.
3. The image is converted to a single-line style SVG using algorithms inspired by pintr.
4. The SVG is then animated using vivus-instant.

## Use Case

AniLine is particularly useful for content creators, especially those in literature and educational video production. It allows for quick generation of visually appealing, animated graphics that can enhance storytelling and engage viewers.

## Current Status

This project is in active development. While the core functionality is implemented, we are continuously working on improving the single-line art conversion process to match the quality of the original pintr project.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions, especially from those with experience in image processing and SVG manipulation. If you're interested in helping improve the single-line art conversion algorithms, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Javier Bórquez for the inspirational pintr project, and to the creators of vivus-instant. This project would not be possible without their groundbreaking work.
